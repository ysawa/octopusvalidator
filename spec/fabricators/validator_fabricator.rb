This tool detects common coding practices that may cause compatibility problems or prevent your users from getting the best possible experience on a webpage. Whenever possible we suggest a fix or enhancement with web standards like HTML5 & CSS3 (or a graceful fallback). It's not a complete checklist for coding the modern web â€“ just a starting point so you can spend less time testing for IE and more time building what matters on the web"
